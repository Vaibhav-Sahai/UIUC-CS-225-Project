# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings**  
Our team will meet once a week on a day that is convenient for us all (no midterms/MPs due). We estimate the meetings to last anywhere from 45 to 60 mins and hope to emulate the style of standup calls. We will take minutes as well and alternate the recorders.
2. **Assistance**   
We will create a discord private chat with all our members where we can share code/schedule calls/ask questions freely. We expect replies within an our on weekends and within 3 hours on weekdays as we will also be having classes.

3. **Respect**   
We will ensure that every member has atleast 3 mins per meeting to articulate their thoughts while everyone has their cameras on and is paying attention. No ideas will be ridiculed and no individual will be made to feel inferior.

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution**   
We will split the work based on how comfortable each member feels with their tech stack. Our overarching goal is to make sure everyone contributes to the best of their abilities. If there arises an oppurtunity where we have to do more work to meet our deliverables, we will arrange a scrum. Although our main goal will be to reduce the number of scrums if possible.

5. **Time Commitment**  
All of us also are commited to CS222 which will take quite a bit out of our time. Hence, we are aiming for 3 hours/week of tested coding and debugging. If a member has time conflicts or can't put in the 3 hours for any reason, he/she must inform others a week prior and we will pick up the slack. All members are capped at 2 excuses.

6. **Conflict Resolution**  
We will aim to mediate conflicts by having an unpartial teammate be the moderator. All concerns will be heard and our main goal would be to make this a learning and enriching environment for all team members. If a teammate is late/unable to finish his/her work, then we would conduct a detailed account of what went wrong and encourage him/her rather than scrutinize them for not delivering. Overall, the main goal should be to create a respectful environment where everyone feels valued and heard.
