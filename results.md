# Results

Through this project, we used the popular platform Twitch and aimed to deduce which streamers play a given game and how they are linked together. We did so by implementing a BFS algorithm to find a connection between the nodes given a start and end node. We also used a PageRank algorithm to identify the most popular node which we defined as the node with the most connections. Our third algorithm was Kruskal's algorithm which was used to convert a MST to a visual graph. Through this we derived ...

## Algorithms

BFS Algorithm : 
    Input: The Start and End Nodes (String type) . 
    Goal: To find the shortest path between the given nodes (Establishes a link between the nodes) . 
    Output: A BFS tree that contains the shortest path between the start and end nodes .
    Test: Defined two nodes and manually derived path and compared it to the path generated by the function to ensure it was accurate  .
