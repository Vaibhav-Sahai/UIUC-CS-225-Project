Through this project, we used the popular platform Twitch and aimed to deduce which streamers play a given game and how they are linked together. We did so by implementing a BFS algorithm to find a connection between the nodes given a start and end node. We also used a PageRank algorithm to identify the most popular node which we defined as the node with the most connections. Our third algorithm was Kruskal's algorithm which was used to convert a MST to a visual graph. Through this we derived ...
